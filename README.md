# Pretty Pink Visual Studio Code Theme (WIP)

An attempt to make an even *more* pink Visual Studio Code (VSC) theme.

Made using `yo generator-code` to easily create and edit a customised VSC theme. [Source](https://medium.com/wearelaika/vscode-create-your-own-custom-theme-extension-96c67bd753f6) from Medium post by Ivan Stevkovski.

I don't know if I will ever finish this.
